	abstract = {Introduction
Hospital emergency codes frequently comprise of colors to prevent confusion and enhance prompt response to emergency situations. The purpose of this study was to identify perceptions of emergency color codes among hospital employees in Korea.
Methods
A 12-color spectrum and emergency situations were selected from the standardized emergency color codes used in the US and Canada. Participants were selected via convenience sampling from four general hospitals in Seoul and Gyeonggi-Do. Between October 25 and November 30, 2016, 295 questionnaires were distributed and 266 of them were analyzed.
Results
The participants showed the highest consistency in the association between emergency images related to colors and emergency code color images associated with emergency situations in the following cases: “red for fire,” “blue for adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),” “yellow for pediatric CPR,” “orange for external disaster,” “pink for infant/child abduction,” “white for deactivation,” and “black for violent/combative person.” Meanwhile, the most confusing colors were purple, gray, and silver. Hospital employees tended to select colors that matched the emergency codes used in their respective hospitals.
Conclusions
The four colors of “red,” “blue,” “pink,” and “white,” were strongly associated with “fire,” “cardiac arrest,” “infant/child abduction,” and “emergency deactivation,” respectively. The use of four colors for hospital emergency code standardization domestically in Korea is recommended.},

The participants were presented with 16 concepts and asked to choose one of 10 colors to represent each concept. The chi-square test results showed that each concept was significantly associated with at least one color. Both the steel workers and the managerial staff primarily associated green with “go” and “safe” and red with “stop” and “danger.” The cross-group comparisons indicated that the steel workers and the managerial staff produced stronger color associations than those produced by the Yunnan Chinese and the Hong Kong Chinese subjects, but weaker than those produced by the US subjects.

	doi = {10.5144/0256-4947.2015.450},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 

Emergency color codes were developed to alert healthcare personnel in a hospital to critical situations. They are often developed independently by each hospital, leading to variability. This could be a source of confusion to healthcare personnel, who move frequently between hospitals and may work at multiple hospitals. This study evaluated the variability of emergency codes for different critical events in hospitals in Riyadh.

METHODS: 

A prospective, cross-sectional survey was carried out on a representative sample of hospitals. Twenty-four of 28 hospitals took part in the study. Semi-structured questionnaires were completed by the Quality/Safety Department of each hospital, on general hospital characteristics, emergency department characteristics, code-response mock-up, code determination, emergency codes used and code meanings.

RESULTS: 

Thirty-four different codes were used across hospitals. The codes used most variably were yellow (10 meanings), orange, black, green (7 meanings each), and gray (5 meanings), while the most consistently used code was ‘Code Red’ for ‘Fire’ in 75\% of hospitals. Another source of variability was the use of non-color codes, representing 7.7\% of total codes.

CONCLUSIONS: 

There is large variability in the type and meaning of emergency codes between hospitals in Riyadh City, reflecting a lack of standardization. Hospitals use color and non-color emergency codes, which could cause confusion to responders and mitigate the effectiveness and speed of response in critical events.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Long‐term care (LTC) facilities are particularly dangerous places for the spread of COVID‐19 given that they house vulnerable high‐risk populations. Transmission‐based precautions to protect residents, employees, and families alike must account for potential risks posed by LTC workersʼ second jobs and unpaid care work. This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs, and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double‐ and triple‐duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses [RNs], licensed practical nurses [LPNs], or certified nursing assistants [CNAs]).

DESIGN
A descriptive secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study.

SETTING
Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States.

PARTICIPANTS
A subset of 958 essential facility‐based LTC workers involved in direct patient care.

MEASUREMENTS
We present information on LTC workersʼ demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double‐ or triple‐duty caregiving roles.

RESULTS
Most LTC workers were CNAs, followed by LPNs and RNs. Overall, more than 70\% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with this statement: “When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work.” One‐sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and more than 60\% held double‐ or triple‐duty caregiving roles. Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among CNAs.

CONCLUSION
LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double‐ and triple‐duty caregiving roles. To slow the spread of COVID‐19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.},

This paper explores the role of effective government communication with the public and its role in mediating the social and psychological impact of terrorist attacks. We examine the importance of effective communication in reducing morbidity and mortality in the event of a terrorist attack and explore the impact of risk perceptions in determining the success or failure of risk communication strategies. This includes the examination of the role of fear as a health risk, and the identification of factors relevant to public trust in risk communication. Finally, an investigation of the type of information desired by members of the public leads the authors to make risk communication recommendations targeted at the promotion of more adaptive behaviours in response to CBRN attacks.},

Drawing upon case studies, the paper employs the risk perception matrix from the field of risk analysis to map and compare the degree of dread risk created by different types of terrorist attacks (CBRNE); and the interplay of terrorism and measures society can undertake to mitigate terror. Case studies include the Second Intifada in Israel, the 1995 Sarin attacks in Tokyo, the London 2005 transport bombings, and 9/11. The paper demonstrates how the risk matrix can provide the public and emergency planners with context to reduce dread, fear and associated adverse avoidance behavior, and how to use information from previous events to guide future planning to augment resilience.},

	abstract = {The common and frequent use of emergency codes by hospitals to communicate during life-threatening emergencies routinely segregates hospital staff from patients, visitors, and first-responders during emergencies by providing each group with a different level of information regarding the threat. By relying on codes instead of plain language to communicate during an emergency, a hospital may introduce ambiguity into a potentially life-threatening situation. Consequently, this means that coded alerts may endanger staff, patients, and visitors rather than protecting them from threats. This paper will maintain that (1) relying on codes, even standardized color codes for hospitals, interferes with the full integration of health care into the National Incident Management System (NIMS); (2) that planning to use plain language notifications improves coordination among response partners and ultimately increases safety for hospital patients, staff, and visitors; and (3) that the change to plain language is both practical and possible. This paper identifies both real world events and studies that demonstrate the benefits of using plain language alerts with directive messaging to elicit the desired response among members of the public during emergencies. This paper also presents guides that hospitals can use to transition from coded emergency messaging to plain language emergency alerts.},

	abstract = {Associations with colors are a rich source of meaning, and there has been considerable interest in understanding the capacity of color to shape our functioning and behavior as a result of color associations. However, abstract conceptual color associations have not been comprehensively investigated, and many of the effects of color on psychological functioning reported in the literature are therefore reliant on ad hoc rationalizations of conceptual associations with color (e.g., blue = openness) to explain effects. In the present work we conduct a systematic, cross-cultural, mapping of conceptual color associations using the full set of hues from the World Color Survey (WCS). In Experiments 1a and 1b we explored the conceptual associations that English monolingual, Chinese bilingual, and Chinese monolingual speaking adults have with each of the 11 Basic English Color Terms (black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, gray). In Experiment 2 we determined which specific physical WCS colors are associated with which concepts in these three language groups. The findings reveal conceptual color associations that appear to be universal across all cultures (e.g., white – purity; blue – water/sky related; green – health; purple – regal; pink – “female” traits) as well as culture specific (e.g., red and orange – enthusiastic in Chinese; red – attraction in English). Importantly, the findings provide a crucial constraint on, and resource for, future work that seeks to understand the effect of color on cognition and behavior, enabling stronger a priori predictions about universal as well as culturally relative effects of conceptual color associations on cognition and behavior to be systematically tested.

This study examined the emergency codes and alerts utilized in Puerto Rican hospi-tals. Objective: To assess hospitals’ level of emergency preparedness and response capability related to the variability of emergency codes and alerts utilized to respond to a situation in Puerto Rico. Method: A survey was conducted to characterize hospital emergency department level of preparedness and response to a mass fatality incident. A total of 39 out of a sample of 44 hospitals participated in the study. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered by the re-search team to members of each hospital’s administrative staff to explore the following: general hospital characteristics, emergency plans, emergency department capacity, collaborative agreements, personnel training, emergency communi-cations, laboratory facilities, treatment protocols, security, epidemiologic surveillance, equipment and infrastructure. Results: Some hospitals in Puerto Rico use color coded emergency alerts, while others use key words or codes. Single color emergency codes can have different meanings in different hospitals. Conclusions: The findings clearly show that there is a lack of uniformity and clarity in the emergency codes utilized by hospitals in Puerto Rico. Single color codes have diverse meanings in different hospitals. This could adversely affect hospitals’ efficient and effective emergency response.},

This paper is a report of a study to determine the opinions of physicians and nurses who work in a university hospital intensive care unit and emergency department about the presence of patients’ families during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in these units. Background. Healthcare professionals have conflicting opinions about the presence of patients’ families during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Families who are allowed to be present have less fear and worry, feel they have supported their family member and are able to cope more easily. Method. The data for this descriptive questionnaire study were collected between November 2006 and January 2007. The respondents were 62 physicians and 82 nurses who worked in an emergency department or in cardiology or anaesthesia intensive care units in Turkey. The data were collected using a questionnaire and the responses summarized using frequencies and percentages. The chi-squared test was performed to test for differences in the opinion by profession, educational level, or number of years of working experience in the profession. Findings. The response rate was 79\%. Of the respondents, 82·6\% did not think it was appropriate for patients’ families to be present during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The most common concerns mentioned were that the family would interfere with the team’s activities (56·3\%) and that resuscitation is a very traumatic procedure (43·6\%). Conclusion. Policies need to be developed regarding this topic because the absence of policy can cause misunderstanding and differences in practice. Further research is needed to determine what public education is needed to facilitate implementation of such policies.},

	abstract = {Objective
Recent international emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines have recommended that health-care professionals allow family members to be present during resuscitation attempts. To assess whether critical care professionals support these recommendations, we surveyed health-care professionals for their opinions regarding family-witnessed resuscitation (FWR).
Methods
We surveyed health-care professionals attending the International Meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians in San Francisco, CA, from October 23 to 26, 2000, about their CPR experience, their opinions on FWR, and demographic characteristics. The opinions of physicians, nurses, and other allied health professionals were compared, and differences in opinions based on demographics were examined.
Results
Five hundred ninety-two professionals were surveyed. Fewer physicians (20\%) than nurses and allied health-care workers combined (39\%) would allow family member presence during adult CPR (p = 0.0037 [χ2 test]). Fourteen percent of physicians and 17\% of nurses would allow a family presence during pediatric CPR. There was a significant difference among the opinions of US professionals, based on regional location. Professionals practicing in the northeastern states were less likely than other US professionals to allow FWR during adult or pediatric resuscitations (p = 0.016 and p {\textless} 0.001, respectively [χ2 test]). Midwestern professionals were more likely than others to allow family members to be present during an adult resuscitation, when compared to professional in the rest of the nation (p = 0.002 [χ2 test]). Health-care professionals disapproving of family member presence during CPR did so because of the fear of psychological trauma to family members, performance anxiety affecting the CPR team, medicolegal concerns, and a fear of distraction to the resuscitation team.
Conclusions
Our evaluation indicated that the majority of critical care professionals surveyed do not support the current recommendations provided by the ECC and CPR guidelines of 2000.},

Within current literature, the attitudes and beliefs towards FP of cardiac health care professionals in Canada are limited. Purpose: The purpose of this project was to examine the perceptions of cardiac health care professionals (n=368) concerning FP during CPR. Method: A survey was conducted to explore the attitudes and beliefs of cardiac health care professionals towards family presence during CPR within five Edmonton and surrounding area hospitals. Results: The response rate was 46\%, with the greatest response from nurses and physicians. Of the respondents, 44.3\% believed that family should have the option to be present, and 40.9\% believed that family should be allowed at the bedside during CPR. Less than half of the respondents had experience with FP during CPR. The barriers identified towards FP were lack of support for families, the experience would be too traumatic for families, families would not understand the procedures, fear of families physically interfering with procedures, FP would increase stress levels among staff, and tradition and politics excludes FP. Conclusion: Despite less than half the respondents supporting FP, the majority endorsed development of policy and procedures to overcome barriers to FP during CPR.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. When a child presents to a trauma center with a serious injury, family members are often excluded from the initial trauma team evaluation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a structured program of family presence during pediatric trauma team activations by measuring (1) the need for termination of family presence, (2) times to completion of key parts of the trauma evaluation, and (3) the opinions of staff surveyed immediately after conclusion of family presence.METHODS. This was a cross-sectional study that combined prospectively obtained data and surveys from trauma team evaluations in which family presence occurred, with retrospective chart review of all trauma activations during an 18-month study period. The study was conducted at a level 1 pediatric trauma center with a preestablished family presence program that assigns a staff member to screen family members for family presence, provide support, and record events. Times to completion of key components of the trauma evaluation were calculated and compared for cases with and without family presence. Cross-sectional surveys were performed immediately after each trauma team evaluation.RESULTS. A total of 197 family members participated in family presence. There were no cases of interference with medical care by family members. Seven family members were asked to leave the trauma area by staff after initiation of family presence for various reasons. Times to completion of key components of the trauma evaluation did not differ significantly between enrolled patients with family presence and those without family presence. Surveys were completed for 136 cases, and the majority of providers reported that family presence either had no effect on or improved medical decision-making (97\%), institution of patient care (94\%), communication among providers (92\%), and communication with family members (98\%).CONCLUSIONS. This prospective study suggests that there is an overall low prevalence of negative outcomes associated with family presence during pediatric trauma team evaluation after implementation of a structured family presence program. Excluding family members as a routine because of provider concerns about negative impact on clinical care does not seem to be indicated.},

in Pennsylvania. For example, an

Background Nurses are on the front lines of disaster and emergency response; however, they report not feeling confident about their disaster preparedness. Methods Participants included 234 nurses working at a general hospital in Korea. Emergency code awareness was measured by recognition of and self-confidence in eight emergency codes, and disaster nursing competencies were measured using the Disaster Nursing Preparedness Response Competency Scale. Data were collected from 17 to 23 October 2019. Results The recognition rate of emergency codes was 87.4\%, whereas the level of self-confidence was 3.30 out of 5. Nurses scored 2.98 out of 5 on disaster preparedness competencies and 3.37 out of 5 on disaster response competencies. Emergency code recognition was positively correlated with self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies (p {\textless} .05). Conclusion Higher recognition of emergency codes among clinical nurses was associated with higher self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies. Further studies need to develop strategies to improve nurses' awareness and confidence concerning emergency codes. Implications for Nursing Management Nurse managers should pay attention to provide more opportunities for disaster education to improve nurses' self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies.},

Background The increasing frequency of disasters worldwide necessitates nurses to adequately prepare to respond to disasters to mitigate the negative consequences of the event on the affected population. Despite growing initiatives to prepare nurses for any disasters, evidence suggests they are under prepared for disaster response. Methods This is a systematic review of scientific articles conducted from 2006 to 2016 on nurses’ preparedness for disasters. SCOPUS, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsychINFO were the primary databases utilized for search of literature. Keywords used in this review were as follows: ‘emergency’, ‘disaster’, ‘disaster preparedness’, ‘disaster competencies’, ‘disaster nursing’, ‘disaster role’ and ‘nurse’. Seventeen (17) articles were selected for this review. Findings Factors that increase preparedness for disaster response include previous disaster response experience and disaster-related training. However, it is widely reported that nurses are insufficiently prepared and do not feel confident responding effectively to disasters. Conclusion The findings of this review contribute to a growing body of knowledge regarding disaster preparedness in nurses and have implications for academia, hospital administration and nursing educators. The findings of this review provide evidence that could be used by nurse educators and nurse administrators to better prepare nurses for disaster response. Implications for nursing and health policy The findings from this review place an emphasis on hospitals to implement policies to address lack of preparedness among their employees. Furthermore, this review highlights the benefit of further research and provision of well-grounded disaster exercises that mimic actual events to enhance the preparedness of the nursing workforce.},

Disasters and the magnitude of destruction are increasing worldwide. Nurses constitute the largest number of healthcare providers and have major roles in disaster response and care. They need to have sufficient knowledge, skill competencies, and preparedness in responding to disasters. This review aimed to evaluate nursing preparedness to disasters in terms of knowledge, skill competencies, and psychological preparedness to disasters.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted from recent research articles published between 2001 and 2018, which included searches from five databases: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Medline, and ScienceDirect. Quality of the selected studies was assessed using Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and the review results were generated through an iterative narrative process of synthesis to identify common themes.
Results
Twelve studies, with a total of 1443 nurses involved, met the inclusion criteria. The articles revealed the need for further development of disaster preparedness of nurses in the aspects of knowledge and skill competencies; and in particular with more focus on the education of nurses to achieve better psychological preparedness.
Conclusion
The results of this review showed that it is important to enhance the psychological preparedness of nurses, in addition to knowledge and skill competencies, so that they can provide the best care possible to affected individuals as well as for themselves.},

	abstract = {Background 
        There has been an increase in violent acts against hospital employees, including active shooter events. Emergency department (ED) staff must be able to respond to these events efficiently to ensure the safest possible outcome. However, few in our ED were aware of our hospital's active shooter protocol. We aimed to increase staff knowledge of and confidence in these guidelines.
        Methods 
        We developed and implemented a 7-week spiral curriculum using the Kern model of curriculum development. Each week, a segment of the hospital active shooter protocol was featured. Multimodal instructional methods including posters, instruction at daily team huddles, descriptions in the weekly division newsletter, and email summaries were used.
        A 10-question assessment was administered to ED staff both before and after the implementation of our curriculum. During both assessments, staff were asked to rate their confidence in both knowledge of and ability to follow hospital active shooter guidelines.
        Results 
        There were 95 and 102 participants in the preintervention and postintervention periods, respectively.
        The median proportion of correct answers on the knowledge assessment increased when comparing preintervention with postintervention performances (P {\textless} 0.05).
        Staff confidence in both knowledge of and ability to follow active shooter protocols increased after the implementation of our curriculum (P {\textless} 0.05).
        Conclusions 
        Our 7-week curriculum resulted in improved knowledge of and confidence in hospital active shooter protocols among ED staff. Given that our sample was an unpaired convenience sample, inferences from our analysis were limited. Tabletop simulations are currently underway to further reinforce and clarify concepts.},

Despite the research that was conducted in this domain, little is known about the consequences of being a victim of workplace violence, specifically in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this article aims to review the literature regarding the consequences of exposure to workplace violence in the healthcare sector. Sixty-eight studies were included in the review and they were evaluated according to 12 criteria recommended for systematic reviews. The studies identified seven categories of consequences of workplace violence: (1) physical, (2) psychological, (3) emotional, (4) work functioning, (5) relationship with patients/quality of care, (6) social/general, and (7) financial. Psychological (e.g., posttraumatic stress, depression) and emotional (e.g., anger, fear) consequences and impact on work functioning (e.g., sick leave, job satisfaction) were the most frequent and important effects of workplace violence. In conclusion, this paper recommends further research, particularly longitudinal studies, in order to better grasp the direct and indirect effects of workplace violence.},

	abstract = {Threat processing is central to understanding debilitating fear- and trauma-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Progress has been made in understanding the neural circuits underlying the “engram” of threat or fear memory formation that complements a decades-old appreciation of the neurobiology of fear and threat involving hub structures such as the amygdala. In this review, we examine key recent findings, as well as integrate the importance of hormonal and physiological approaches, to provide a broader perspective of how bodily systems engaged in threat responses may interact with amygdala-based circuits in the encoding and updating of threat-related memory. Understanding how trauma-related memories are encoded and updated throughout the brain and the body will ultimately lead to novel biologically-driven approaches for treatment and prevention.},
